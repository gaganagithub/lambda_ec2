How do I use Lambda to stop and start Amazon EC2 instances at regular intervals

Use AWS Lambda and Amazon EventBridge to automatically stop and start Amazon EC2 instances

1.Create a custom AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy and IAM role for your Lambda function.

* Use the JSON policy editor to create an IAM policy. Paste the following JSON policy document into the policy editor:

{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "logs:CreateLogGroup",
        "logs:CreateLogStream",
        "logs:PutLogEvents"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:logs:*:*:*"
    }, 
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "ec2:Start*",
        "ec2:Stop*"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}

Now  Create an IAM role for Lambda.
Important: When you attach a permissions policy to Lambda, make sure that you choose the IAM policy that you just created.

2.Create Lambda functions that stop and start your EC2 instances.

1.    Open the Lambda console, and then choose Create function.
2.    Choose Author from scratch.
3.    Under Basic information, enter the following information:
For Function name, enter a name that identifies it as the function that's used to stop your EC2 instances. For example, "StopEC2Instances".
For Runtime, choose Python 3.9.
Under Permissions, expand Change default execution role.
Under Execution role, choose Use an existing role.
Under Existing role, choose the IAM role that you created.
4.    Choose Create function.
5.On the Code tab, under Code source, paste the following code into the editor pane in the code editor on the lambda_function tab. These code stop and start the EC2 instances that you identify.
###Python function to stop ec2 instance

import boto3
region = 'ap-south-1'
instances = ['i-07b8d37d00273e949']
ec2 = boto3.client('ec2', region_name=region)

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    ec2.stop_instances(InstanceIds=instances)
    print('stopped your instances: ' + str(instances))

***Python function to start  ec2 instance

import boto3
region = 'us-west-1'
instances = ['i-12345cb6de4f78g9h', 'i-08ce9b2d7eccf6d26']
ec2 = boto3.client('ec2', region_name=region)

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    ec2.start_instances(InstanceIds=instances)
    print('started your instances: ' + str(instances))

3.Test your Lambda functions
1.Open the Lambda console, and then choose Functions.
2.Choose one of the functions that you created.
3.Choose the Code tab.
4.In the Code source section, choose Test.
5.In the Configure test event dialog box, choose Create new test event.
6.Enter an Event name. Then, choose Create.
Note: Don't change the JSON code for the test event. The function doesn't use it.
Choose Test to run the function.

You can check the status of your EC2 instances before and after testing to confirm that your functions work as you expect.
